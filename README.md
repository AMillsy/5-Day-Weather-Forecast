## What I have learnt

This is the first time using Server Side APIs and how to get data from the APIs. It was interesting how to get the data and then how to convert and use the data. This week we had to make a weather forecast using Openweathermap.org. The first API would get the Latitude and Longitude, which then was passed onto the second API that would get the forecast in the location that I presented. I found it enjoyable to read the documentation and then learn how to manipulate the JSON that I retrieved.

I found it difficult to understand the JSON I received back because I had to make a 5-day forecast, but when getting the JSON, you get 3-hour timestamps. I had to manipulate the data I retrieved to get the results I wanted. Furthermore, it was interesting going through the query string, to see how my data would come back and how I could use that new, sorted data.

## Usage
